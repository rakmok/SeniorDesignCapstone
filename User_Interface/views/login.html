    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>All household pet owners must remember to feed their pets—whether they are birds, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, or cats—at set periods during the day. But there can be times when people forget to feed their pets, double feed them, or have trouble feeding them on schedule. This can be due to poor communication between family members or even occur when pet owners come home late from work or prior commitments. During these times, pets either overeat, go hungry, or eat irregularly. As a result, timer-based pet feeders have been developed to release food at set intervals. When food sits out for extended periods of time, the risk of the food becoming stale or getting infected with bugs increases drastically [4.1]. <br>
        <br>
        If an insect is near your food, it is a common reaction to remove or swat it away, but that mechanism is not present for the pet’s food bowl, especially when the family is not at home. Another issue is that smarter pets can nose into the food storage and overeat or eat something that their bodies will reject (like chocolate for dogs). With a set schedule to limit food dispensation throughout the day, the pet will not take advantage of either a careless overpour of food or of an unmanned food station. Furthermore, data on how much food was dispensed and eaten will help track and optimize the pet’s eating habits. 
    </p>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
        We are seeking to solve this problem by having timers coupled with a button and RFID component to release food—thus preventing overeating. Given all of these conditions, the dispenser will release the pet food. This ensures that the pet is not only fed on time, but that the food is not polluted when the pet goes to eat; additionally, a chime will go off signaling to the pet that it is time for them to eat [4.2]. We will incorporate a notification system to alert the owner(s) whether the pet has eaten or when the food store has low levels of food.<br>
        <br>
        If the pet were to not eat all the food at once and leave the food dispenser, the pressure sensor will tell the dispenser to cover the food until the pet returns ensuring freshness and preventing bugs. 
    </p>
    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>
        We are pet enthusiasts and thought of this idea as we have faced the problem of bugs getting into our pet's food or trying to remember if we fed or double fed our pets when taking care of our own pets. We have included images of our pets below.
