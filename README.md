# SeniorDesignCapstone

This is the repository to record and motivate the [name of project] project for ECE 445: Senior Design in the Spring of 2025. The group members are Arash Amiri, Kathryn Thompson, and Omkar Kulkarni.

The project entails the analysis, design, and build of a smart charger. The initial features of this charger will include laptop-to-laptop charging capability, battery health monitoring, and the ability to set a battery percentage value for the device to charge up to. In short, this will be a bi-directional low-voltage DC-DC converter with control and communications sub-systems. Additionally, the charger will include a display that would list certain values like the voltage or battery charge.
