# SeniorDesignCapstone

This is the repository to record and motivate the [name of project] project for ECE 445: Senior Design in the Spring of 2025. The group members are Arash Amiri, Kathryn Thompson, and Omkar Kulkarni.

The project entails the analysis, design, and build of a smart charger. The initial features of this charger will include laptop-to-laptop charging capability, battery health monitoring, and the ability to set a battery percentage value for the device to charge up to. In short, this will be a bi-directional low-voltage DC-DC converter with control and communications sub-systems. Additionally, the charger will include a display that would list certain values like the voltage or battery charge.

# Motivation
All devices have batteries. As a result, we are constantly carrying chargers for the devices we have. If we are lucky, we may only have to carry one or two chargers, but in the worse case-scenarios, one might have to carry a different charger for the laptop, tablet, phone, headphones, etc. The more devices one has, the harder it becomes to ensure that all devices carry a sufficient charge. To manage this problem, we turn to carrying all these chargers on us wherever we go. This not only gets heavy, but it also becomes difficult to remember to pack and unpack the various chargers every time we go to places. In the end, this ultimately leads to one forgetting their charger when it is critical to have one. 

We will develop a wireless solution to this problem where if you forget your laptop charger, often the bulkiest and heaviest of the chargers, you will still be able to charge your laptop. This wireless charging method not only reduces the wired tripping hazards, but it also saves space and reduces the strain on the back...

ok still needs to get tweaked when we work out a little more details
