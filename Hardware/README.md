# KiCAD Board Repository

This is the hardware repository with all of our KiCAD boards. We have five: two power boards, a brain board, an RFID board, and the motor driver board. If you are unable to see symbols on the schematic capture, you will need to go to schematic editor->Preferences->Configure Paths and manually add a large parts library that you can link from Hardware/Libraries folder courtesey of Illini Solar Car.

For all of the parts that we dowloaded from 3rd party sites, there is a folder called Parts (Hardware/Parts), which has the symbols, footprints, and some .step files. This can be linked by going to schematic editor->Preferences->Manage Symbol Libraries. The same must be done for all the footprints in the PCB editor under Preferences->Manage Footprint Libraries. Three images below depict the path libraries for Omkar's KiCAD. Note that Omkar's file path for the Solar Car library is completely different and the Parts library is about three steps upstream from what you should linkâ€”you should add SeniorDesignCapstone/Hardware/Parts as your filepath instead of ../ECE445/Parts. There is also a courtesey template to get started, though you will need to set up the Illini Solar Car Libraries folder or you won't be able to retrieve parts with the 'a' hotkey.
