After the first ECE 445 lecture, the group assembled to discuss and hash-out viable ideas for our project. We had previously met during winter break and gone through a number of project ideas related to solar power, cybersecurity, microcontroller development, vehicle architecure, cell balancing, and smart charging. In this session, the group researched ideas that fit the complexity and scope of what we believed was expected of us by the course staff. We made an initial project proposal post on the web board on smart charging technology, which includes battery health monitoring, voltage/current control, possibly the abilility to set charging percentage, and the ability to charge laptop-to-laptop. In this process, we discarded ideas related to cell-balancing and security because they were either too complex to implement or the group (as a whole) did not have enough expertise to pursue the idea.

We got an opportunity to ask the head TA about course logistics and project complexity. His feedback suggested that laptop-to-phone charging was too simple and if we wanted to work on high-voltage charging, every member of the group would need to get trained. Currently, we are assessing what is possible to complete within a semester and still complex enough to aim for being a featured project.
