During class, we listened to a lot of ideas and heard various feedback on the types of projects that are suggested for the scope of this course. I worked with my two team members and finalized the group and its goal.
After the class, we made an initial web-board post on a potential power for laptop-to-laptop charging.

We all met as a group to check the feedback received from the TAs. We then went on to look at other various project avenues and ideas. One idea we came up with was a smart security system that was
more complete and had more sensors than usual things seen.

We all met in the ECE 445 Senior Design Lab to go over all the feedback received since the last meetup. There was growing concern about the commonness of the security system and we talked to the TA regarding 
his suggestions on how to make our project get approved or if he had any possible fixes. The idea of a pet food dispenser came about as we were bouncing ideas off and Michael Molter helped get our idea
converted into a more profound end-to-end project.

Worked on the Team contract with the team as we awaited RFA project approval. I looked at a high-level timeline for what progress throughout this semester should look like and started checking out
pros and cons of various microcontrollers, sensors, and protocols. I started looking at parts both physical and those more related to electrical components.

Talked to Gregg from the ECE Supply Shop to discuss various issues and kinks with our project. Got a better idea of what the design would look like and what parts are needed. Went over the various kinds of
motors that can run this project and how to handle the lid system. Started and made almost finished progress on the Proposal document.

Went back to Gregg to get a more finalized design and what parts to include. With my team, I voiced a few concerns on simple design choices just to know what to better expect when we build the design.
Looked at some ESP32 specifications to make sure the additions and fixes are within scope.
