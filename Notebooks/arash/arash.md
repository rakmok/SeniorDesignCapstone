During class we listened to a lot of ideas and heard various feedback on the types of projects that are suggested for the scope of this course. I worked with my two team members and finalized the group and it's goal.
After the class we made an intital web-board post ona  potential power for laptop to laptop charging.

We all met as a group to check the feedback received from the TAs. We then went on to look at other various project avenues and ideas. One idea we came up with was a smart security system that was
more complete and had more sensors than usual things seen.

We all met in the ECE 445 Senior Design Lab to go over all the feedbacak receievd since the last meetup. There was growing ocncern on the commonness of the security system and we talked to the TA regarding 
his suggestions on how to make our project get approved or if he had any possible fixes. The idea of a pet food sispensor came about as we were boucning ideas off and Michael Molter helped get our idea
converted into a more profound end to end project.

Talked to Gregg from the ECE Supply Shop to discuss various issues and kinks with our project. Got a better idea of what the design would look like and what parts are needed. Went oer the various kinds of
motors that can run this project and how to handle the lid system.

Went back to Gregg to get a more finalized design and what parts to include. With my team, I voiced few cocnerns on simple design choices just to know what to better expect when we build the design.
Looked at some ESP32 specifications to make sure the additions and fixes are within scope.
